## Requirements

Python 3.6+.

> **Note**
>
> Because [Python 2.7 support ended January 1, 2020](https://pythonclock.org/), new projects 
> should consider supporting Python 3 only, which is simpler than trying to support both. As a 
> result, support for Python 2.7 in this example project has been dropped.
